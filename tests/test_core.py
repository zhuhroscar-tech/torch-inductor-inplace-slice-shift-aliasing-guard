"""Tests for torch-inductor-inplace-slice-shift-aliasing-guard.
Requires the 'torch' extra (skipped otherwise).

Design mirrors this fleet's established discipline: every guard claim
is backed by a real reproduction, not an assumption, and at least one
test proves the test suite itself would have failed before the fix
(bug-injection verification), not just that the fixed code path
returns success. Includes an independent oracle (row-by-row
index-copy into a fresh tensor) that shares no code with either the
buggy pattern or the guard.
